  finishingText: "We've found a Giant Panda! This large bear is only found in the remote, mountainous regions of the Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. \n These animals spend around 12 hours a day just eating! I think I would be ill if I were to eat for that long... \n As well as the bamboo, these Panda bears also eat bugs, fish and rodents, though bamboo is still the favourite. Let us take a picture of this Panda so we can leave him in peace to eat. \n Let's choose another country to visit!",
