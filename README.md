Edinburgh Sandwich Auction

Purpose:

My app is designed to make eating at sandwich shops more affordable, quicker and simpler.

From a sandwich shop's perspective, my app is designed to boost customers and revenue and help them gain reviews of their sandwiches.

Frameworks: Rails
Libraries: React

To run this app, you'll need to run the following commands:
Top Level:
 npm install
 
In client
 npm install --save react react-dom
 npm install
 npm install --save-dev babel-loader babel-core babel-preset-react
 npm install --save react-router@3.0.2
  Note: older version of react so uses React.propTypes instead of PropTypes.
